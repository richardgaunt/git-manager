# Testing Strategy for Git Manager

This document outlines the testing strategy for the Git Manager CLI application, focusing on software engineering principles rather than implementation details.

## Testing Levels

### Unit Testing

Unit tests will focus on testing individual functions in isolation, particularly:

- **API Layer Functions**: Each function in `api.mjs` should be tested independently to verify it produces the expected output for a given input.
- **Command Implementations**: Core functionality in the command modules should be tested with mocked dependencies.
- **Utility Functions**: Helper functions like `toKebabCase` should have comprehensive test cases.

### Integration Testing

Integration tests will verify that components interact correctly:

- **Command Execution Flow**: Test that commands properly leverage the API functions and handle their outputs correctly.
- **Interactive Menu System**: Verify the menu system correctly routes to appropriate commands.
- **Error Handling**: Confirm errors from git commands are properly captured and reported to users.

### End-to-End Testing

Full workflow tests using real git operations:

- **Feature Branch Creation**: Test the entire workflow from branch creation to stashing and applying changes.
- **Hotfix Workflow**: Verify the complete hotfix creation and completion process.
- **Branch Management**: Test deletion, checkout, and other branch operations from start to finish.

## Testing Approaches

### Mocking Strategy

1. **Git Command Mocking**:
   - Create mock responses for git commands to simulate various repository states
   - Mock execSync to return predefined outputs based on git command inputs
   - Simulate git errors to test error handling

2. **Filesystem Mocking**:
   - Simulate repository directory structures
   - Mock file operations when needed

3. **User Input Mocking**:
   - Simulate Inquirer prompt responses to test interactive workflows
   - Test various user input scenarios including edge cases

### Test Repository Fixtures

1. **Local Repository Setup**:
   - Create temporary git repositories for testing
   - Initialize with standard branches (main/develop)
   - Pre-populate with relevant commit history for testing scenarios

2. **Repository State Scenarios**:
   - Clean repository (no changes)
   - Repository with uncommitted changes
   - Repository with conflicts
   - Repository with specific branch structures

### Command Testing

1. **Direct Command Testing**:
   - Verify each CLI command works as expected
   - Test command flags and options
   - Test command aliases

2. **Interactive Mode Testing**:
   - Verify menu navigation
   - Test selection handling
   - Validate user input processing

## Test Categories

### Functional Tests

- Verify each command produces the correct changes to a git repository
- Test that branches are created, deleted, or modified as expected
- Confirm stashing and unstashing operations work correctly
- Verify branch merging operations

### Error Handling Tests

- Test how the application handles git errors
- Verify user input validation
- Test behavior when prerequisites are not met
- Confirm appropriate error messages are shown

### Edge Case Tests

- Test behavior with unusual branch names
- Verify handling of concurrent git operations
- Test with empty repositories
- Test with large numbers of branches

## Testing Tools & Infrastructure

### Recommended Testing Stack

- **Test Framework**: A JavaScript testing framework compatible with ES modules
- **Mocking Library**: Tools for mocking child_process, filesystem, and user inputs
- **Test Repository Management**: Utilities for creating and managing test repositories
- **CI Integration**: Tests that can run in a CI environment

### Test Environment Setup

- Isolated test repositories to prevent affecting real user repositories
- Environment preparation for each test suite
- Clean-up procedures for test repositories
- Controlled git configuration for testing

## Test-Driven Development Approach

For new features:

1. Write tests that define the expected behavior
2. Implement the feature to satisfy the tests
3. Refactor while maintaining test coverage
4. Add edge case tests as needed

## Coverage Goals

- **API Functions**: 95%+ coverage
- **Command Implementations**: 85%+ coverage
- **Error Handling Paths**: 90%+ coverage
- **Interactive Components**: 80%+ coverage

## Testing Challenge Areas

- **Git State Management**: Testing scenarios that require specific git repository states
- **Interactive CLI Testing**: Simulating user inputs for interactive prompts
- **Process Execution**: Testing functions that execute git commands without affecting the real system
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Ensuring tests work across different operating systems
