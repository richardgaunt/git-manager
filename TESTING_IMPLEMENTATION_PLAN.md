# Testing Implementation Priority Plan

Based on the Git Manager codebase, here's a prioritized approach to implementing testing:

## Phase 1: Core API Unit Tests

Start by testing the fundamental git operations in `api.mjs`:

1. **Basic Git Status Functions**
   - `isGitRepository()`
   - `getCurrentBranch()`
   - `getLocalBranches()`
   - `getStatus()`

2. **Branch Management Functions**
   - `checkoutBranch()`
   - `createBranch()`
   - `deleteLocalBranch()`
   - `getAllBranches()`
   - `toKebabCase()` (utility function)

These functions form the foundation of the application's functionality, are relatively simple to test in isolation, and have clear inputs and outputs. Testing these first will:

- Establish the testing framework
- Create patterns for mocking git commands
- Validate core functionality that other features depend on

## Phase 2: Simple Command Implementations

Next, test individual command implementations that have minimal dependencies:

1. **Branch Listing**
   - `listBranches()` command
   
2. **Branch Deletion**
   - `branchesActions()` - focus on the delete branch functionality

These commands have straightforward workflows and rely on the already-tested API functions, making them good candidates for the second phase.

## Phase 3: Complex Command Workflows

Move on to test more complex Git workflows:

1. **Feature Branch Creation**
   - `createFeatureBranch()` workflow
   
2. **Branch Checkout with Updates**
   - `checkoutBranchAndUpdate()` workflow

These commands involve multiple steps, stashing changes, and interactive user prompts, so they build on the previous test infrastructure.

## Phase 4: Integration Tests

Create integration tests that verify components work together:

1. **Command Registration**
   - Test that commands are properly registered with Commander.js
   
2. **Command Execution Flow**
   - Test that invoking commands through the CLI entry point works correctly

3. **Interactive Menu Flow**
   - Test the menu system redirects to the correct commands

## Phase 5: End-to-End Tests with Test Repositories

Finally, implement tests using real git repositories:

1. **Feature Branch Workflow**
   - Create feature branches in a test repository
   - Verify correct branch naming and change management
   
2. **Hotfix Workflow**
   - Test complete hotfix creation and merging

## Implementation Notes

### First Steps for Implementation

1. **Set up testing framework**
   - Add testing dependencies to package.json
   - Configure test runner for ES modules
   - Create initial test directory structure

2. **Create git command mocking utilities**
   - Develop a system to mock `execSync` calls
   - Define standard git command responses

3. **Implement first simple test**
   - Start with `getCurrentBranch()` as it's simple and fundamental

### Testing Challenges to Address Early

1. **ES Module Support**
   - Testing tools may need special configuration for ES modules (`.mjs` files)

2. **Child Process Mocking**
   - Create robust mocking for `execSync` that can return different values based on git commands

3. **Test Repository Setup**
   - Develop a utility to create and clean up test git repositories

### Metrics to Track

- **Test Coverage**: Start tracking coverage from the beginning
- **Test Reliability**: Monitor for flaky tests, especially with git operations
- **Test Performance**: Keep execution time reasonable as the test suite grows
